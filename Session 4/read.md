<b>Objective</b>
<li>Finally after 4 code iterations achieve:
<ol>99.4% accuracy</ol>
<ol>Less than 15k Parameters under 15 epochs
<ol>Have started from a Vanilla network (no BN, DropOut, LR, larger batch size, change in Optimizer, etc)</ol>
<ol>Make sure you are tracking your code's performance, and writing down your observations are you achieve better or worse results</ol>
<ol>Your second code can only have max 2 improvements over first one, third can have only max 2 over second and so on.</ol>
<ol>All of your iterations are in different CODE BLOCKS and named properly like First CODE, Second CODE, etc</ol>
<ol>All of your iterations have a Header note, describing what all you are planning to do in this code</ol>
<ol>All of your code is very well documented</ol>
<ol>There is a readme file (or embedded documentation) describing your codes and steps you've taken</ol>
</li>
